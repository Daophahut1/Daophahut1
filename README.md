### Hi there👋, welcome!


Hello!👋 My name is Mr. Daophahut Mehalath. I am from Savannakhet, Laos. ສະບາຍດີ🙏🤗✨
I have a huge interest in coding and AI. I love to learn new things and never stop learning.

With 3+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Flutter, Python and modern front-end technologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects.

I am also passionate about AI Automation, especially n8n, and am learning and developing my skills in this area.

I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning to drive innovation and deliver exceptional results. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
